# **100 days of machine learning codes**

## **`To-Do`**

Within the period of 100 days i would read and practice enough data science and machine learning texts to be competent in the subject area. A total of six topics would be studied, with each topic having a total 16 days study period.

**`Basic Topics`**
> 
    1. Numpy : Numerical computation package in python.
    2. Pandas : package that contains data structures and data manipulation tools designed to make data
    cleaning and analysis fast and easy in Python
    3. Matplotlib : Data Visualization package.
    4. Scikit-learn : It contains a number of state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms.
    5. TensorFlow : 
    6. Pytorch : 

### **`Resources`**

The following resources would be used for each stage:
