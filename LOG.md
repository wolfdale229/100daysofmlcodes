# **100 days of machine learning codes**

## **`To-Do`**

Within the period of 100 days i would read and practice enough data science and machine learning texts to be competent in the subject area. A total of six topics would be studied, with each topic having a total 16 days study period.

**`Basic Topic(s)`**
> 
    1. Numpy : Numerical computation package in python.
    2. Pandas : package that contains data structures and data manipulation tools designed to make data
    cleaning and analysis fast and easy in Python
    3. Matplotlib : Data Visualization package.

**`Intermediate Topic(s)`**
>
    1. Scikit-learn : It contains a number of state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms.
    
**`Advance Topic(s)`**
>
    1. `TensorFlow` : TensorFlow is an end-to-end open source platform for machine learning. It has a 
    comprehensive, flexible ecosystem of tools, libraries and community resources that lets researchers 
    push the state-of-the-art in ML and developers easily build and deploy ML powered applications... 
    https://www.tensorflow.org/
    2. `Pytorch` :  It is a deep learning research platforms built to provide maximum flexibility and 
    speed... https://pytorch.org/

## **`Resources`**

The following resources would be used for each stage:

**`Books`**
>
    1. Python for Data Analysis.(Wes McKinney)
    2. Introduction to Machine Learning with Python.(Andreas C. Müller & Sarah Guido)
    3. Hands-on Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn,Keras & TensorFlow.(Aurélien Géron)

**`Data Repositories`**
>
    4. https://www.kaggle.com
    5. http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/index.php

**`Blogs`**
>
    6. https://www.machinelearningmastery.com
    7. https://www.mrdbourke.com/

**`Software`**
>
    8. Anaconda/jupyter notebook : Anaconda is the standard platform for Python data science, leading in 
    open source innovation for machine learning... https://www.anaconda.com .
    9. Goggle Colab : Colaboratory, or "Colab" for short, is a product from Google Research. Colab allows 
    anybody to write and execute arbitrary python code through the browser, and is especially well suited 
    to machine learning, data analysis and education... https://research.google.com/colaboratory
    
## Day 0 : 18-04-2020

**`Today's Progress`** : Set up a git repository, work through the resource's section and get everything
ready .Learn Numpy's data types and how to create a n-dimensional array.
